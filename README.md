# 50 Shades of Scarlet

I am ghostwriter of the book, "50 Shades of Scarlet", like the famous "50 Shades of Gray" but with roles reversed. The book features 50 authentic stories of a woman dominating a man by queening him for her pleasure. While there is no emoji for queening (yet), I find Urban Dictionary's entry for [Queening](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Queening) is very apt. The stories are narrated as adventures of Summer, a woman of color who regains self-confidence and a zest for life after stumbling into a three-way relationship with a doting husband and a submissive lover, identfied only as Slave. I am on story number 18 an seeking my muse to complete the journey. Open to meeting interesting and interested women for inspiration with the possibility of healthy playtime. Let's create, collaborate and connect!
